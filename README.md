# Studiptroll - Experimenting with Selenium's browser automation

## What the hell have I stumbled upon here?
This project tries to combine the fun and power of Selenium with something useful, like automating Stud.IP's features.
This version isn't really useful, though - yet!

### Usage and Installation
Checkout the latest version via git:

    git fetch http://github.com/ennoente/studiptroll.git

Since this is Maven project you can simply compile to jar via

    mvn clean compile assembly:single

and run by executing the jar file (placed into the target directory)
